Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business capability. Unlike traditional monolithic applications, where all functionality is packaged into a single deployable unit, microservices break down the system into individual components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

üîÑ Why Microservices?
In a traditional monolithic system, a failure in one module (e.g., "get account balance") can bring down the entire system ‚Äî affecting unrelated services like loan or insurance processing. This tight coupling and shared memory space often lead to scalability and maintenance challenges.

Microservices help solve this problem by decentralizing services. For example, a bank application might separate services like:

Accounts

Loans

Insurance

Credit cards

Phone banking

Each service is deployed separately and can fail, scale, or update independently without impacting others.

‚úÖ Advantages of Microservices
Independence: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually.

Fault isolation: One service crash won‚Äôt crash the whole system.

Technology flexibility: Each service can use different tech stacks.

Faster development: Teams can work on services in parallel.

Better scalability: Only the high-demand services need to scale.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges of Microservices
Increased complexity due to distributed systems

Requires proper service discovery, API gateways, and logging

Initial setup and deployment might be more effort than monoliths

üß™ Use Case in This Project
In this hands-on exercise:

The Account Microservice returns basic account details.

The Loan Microservice returns loan details.

Both services are independent Spring Boot REST APIs with no backend (dummy responses).

They run on separate ports (e.g., 8083 and 8081) to simulate real-world deployment.

This simple setup shows how microservices can be:

Independent

Individually testable

Easily deployable
